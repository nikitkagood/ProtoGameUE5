These fonts include a license that allows free commercial use: sometimes referred to as a desktop license. 
This allows you to install the fonts on a computer and use them to create posters, web graphics, game graphics, t-shirts, videos, signs, logos and more. Read the license agreement for details. 
If you'd like to embed these fonts in an app, on the web or anything that's not covered by the desktop license agreement, visit the link below. You'll find distributors who offer different types of licenses, or you can contact me for help.
